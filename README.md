# Clean-Water-for-All
Tech stack used:

    HTML5
    CSS

    Why I used this stack:

As this was part of our Introduction to Web Development course, we were expected to use plain HTML, then add CSS.
Requirements:
Home, About, Our Work/Events, Gallery, Get Involved/Bookings, Contact page

My Process:

    I had first designed the website in Figma, both the desktop and mobile versions.
    Made use of HTML5 to implement the 6 pages and their content (headings, copy, images, links and forms)
    Added styling and responsiveness with CSS3

    My Challenges:
    CSS is easy but a little bit difficult, I was struggling with styling some of the pages and I watched some of Youtube videos to make my website better.
