# Clean Water for All

### Who or what is Clean Water for All?

My non-profit organization is called Clean Water for All. We are a group of environmentally 
conscious students, and we have been joined by public health advocates who witnessed a 
decreased access to clean water. We baave recognized that climate change and aging 
infrastructure were hitting underfunded communities the hardest, turning water into a crisis.

### What I struggled with:

The JavaScript. I was watching tutorials, and courses online and following along for the most part, but sometimes a concept wouldn't be clear to me. The interactive maps were even harder.

I also struggled a bit with the design. I'm better at coding than I am at designing, admittedly.
## Tech Stack Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

### Why I used this stack:
As this was part of our Introduction to Web Development, we were expected to use plain HTML, then add CSS, then finish with JavaScript functionality in order to showcase we understood what was being taught.
