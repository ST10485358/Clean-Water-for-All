<h1>South Africas worsening water security crisis</h1>
<p>Climate change can have deleterious effects on water quantity and quality. The effects of extreme weather events on water availability,
predictability and pollution are increasing, threatening sustainable development, biodiversity and access to water and sanitation. In addition to contaminating land and water resources, flooding and rising sea levels can cause damage to water and sanitation infrastructure, such as water points, wells, toilets and wastewater treatment plants.
Droughts and wildfires are triggering civil unrest and migration in many areas. Destruction of vegetation and tree cover exacerbates soil erosion and reduces groundwater recharge,
increasing water scarcity and food insecurity. In addition, climate change is likely to increase water demand while shrinking water supplies. This shifting balance means that policymakers are faced with simultaneously meeting the needs of growing populations, sensitive ecosystems, farmers, ranchers, energy producers and manufacturers.</p>
<p>Compounding the problems created by climate change is the poor governance of the country’s water systems. This includes limited maintenance of ageing infrastructure, which results in extensive water losses, as well as a lack of investment. Combined with low rainfall in recent years, this has caused severe water crises such as the Cape Town water shortage from 2014 to 2017.
According to Earth.Org, about 70 million litres of treated clean drinkable water is estimated to be lost daily through extensive leaks in the country’s water piping system.
Increasingly, water scarcity issues are being taken up by civil society. The Water Crisis Committee, formed in response to the extensive leaks in the country’s water piping system for example, has fixed more than 9 700 leaks while also lobbying the government to be more proactive in addressing the issue.</p>
<p>Pollution from wastewater is one of the key drivers of biodiversity loss and a major threat to human health, particularly affecting the most vulnerable people and ecosystems.
But it can become a valuable resource when adequately treated. The safe and appropriate management of wastewater for resource recovery and reuse goes beyond achieving water security;
it can also potentially improve the health and well-being of individuals, while at the same time reducing the dependence on artificial fertilisers.</p>
